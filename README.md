## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Media queries

### What I’ve learned

My main takeaway from this project was learning how to use flexbox and media queries properly, in order to create a responsive layout for desktop (default: 1400x800) and mobile (default: 375x667).

### Continued development

Since I am just a beginner in programming (overall), I’m focusing my studies in web development. My goal is to master as much HTML, CSS, JS and Typescript as possible because I think that building strong fundamentals come before mastering frameworks.
